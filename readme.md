# Django-Vue-Postgresql-Docker template

This is an experimental template project using vanilla Django together with VueJS CLI trying to mimic a SPA layout often used in DRF+Vue CDN combination. 
This take will eliminate the need for two separate servers for front end and back end whilst keeping the nice, structured layout that Vue apps provide, together with easy setup process thanks to Docker Compose. It also comes with additional frameworks such as Vuex and Vue Router. In no shape or form is it meant to have the best performance or to be used in anything larger than personal "_just-for-fun_" projects.
